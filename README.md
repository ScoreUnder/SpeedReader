SpeedReader
===========

This is a cross-platform SpeedReader developed with Qt, which I did as my first big C++ project, so don't be too hard on me. It is licensed under the GPL v2 terms. [Speed reading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading) is a technique to read any kinds of texts super fast. If you have any ideas on how to improve the SpeedReader or its code, simply write an [email](mailto:niklas.baudy@vanniktech.de) to me or fork the project. If you have any problems or you have found any issues or bugs, feel free to report them.

## Features
- read multiple words
- speedread from 300 up to 3000 words per minute
- customize text style and appearance
- number grouping (10 000 won't be displayed seperately, because of the whitespace; condition: one word at a time)
- stop- delay- and break-words
- longer words get displayed longer
- option to stall at indentions
- command line interface ([options are described here](http://vanniktech.de/SpeedReader/#cli))
- overview to see, what you've already read of your text and what is going to come
- calculation of estimated reading time

## Building

I use Qt Creator to build and develop SpeedReader. I am using Qt v5.4.1. If you want to build the SpeedReader with Qt 4.x.x, you may run into some problems, because the application does use some new Qt functions. Also building the app with qmake is not recommended, since you may run into some errors depending on your system environment.
